## Program Description
This repository contains three classes - Fan, Car, and Pet - each representing different objects (fan, car, and pet) with specific attributes and methods to interact with and modify their properties. The accompanying test programs demonstrate the creation and manipulation of instances of these classes, showcasing their functionality and utility in various scenarios.

## Functionalities
The Fan class represents a fan and provides functionalities to adjust its speed, turn it on/off, change its radius, and modify its color. A test program demonstrates the creation of two Fan objects with specific properties and displays their attributes.

The Car class simulates a car and allows users to interact with its attributes such as year model, brand, and speed. It provides methods to accelerate and brake the car's speed, as well as a getter method to retrieve the current speed.

The Pet class encapsulates pet attributes like name, animal type, and age. It allows the users to input their pet's information, store it as the object's attributes, and retrieve and display the pet's name, type, and age.

## General info
The Fan class provides functionalities to control a fan's speed, power, radius, and color, while the Car class simulates a car and enables users to manipulate its attributes such as year model, brand, and speed. The Pet class encapsulates pet attributes and offers methods to set and retrieve information like name, animal type, and age.
